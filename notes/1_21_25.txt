what is a computer network?
- interconnected computers able to exchange information or resources

direct connectivity
- every node connected to every other node
- doesn't scale well
- resource/space intensive

internet
- inter-connection
- indirect connectivity: single network
- use switches to connect computer nodes
- scales better
- how does switch know where to direct data

interconnecting multiple subnetworks 
- router connects switches from different subnetworks
- does each device need to know all devices in each subnetworks

autonomous systems
- one or more subnets controlled by a single entity
- ISP
- cloud (AWS)
- Enterprise (JHU)


the Internet:

- ARPANET: foundation of the Internet
  - packet switched WAN (not circuit switched)
  - distributed control - separate entities controlled different parts
  - used TCP/IP protocol
- Internet exploded out of the lab
  - currently ~80 k autonomous systems
  - no single entity knows everything

core concepts
- end-to-end principle
- abstraction: layering and protocols
- encapsulation
- socket programming

end-to-end principle
- keep middle as simple as possible
- push intelligence to the end
- result: rapid innovation at the edge uses reliable and consistent middle

abstractions: layering protocols
- each layer provides consistent interface to layer above
  - implementation independent
- layer depends only on layer immediately beneath it
- layer provides services only to layer directly above it

mapping OSI model to the Internet
- OSI
  - Application
  - Presentation
  - Session
  - Transport
  - Network
  - Data link
  - Physical
- Internet
  - App
  - Transport
  - Network
  - Link


Internet Protocols
- app
  - ftp, http, dns, nfs
- transport
  - udp
  - tcp
- network
  - IP
- link L2
  - ethernet
  - wifi
  - 5G
narrow waist facilitates network interconnectivity

Internet also referred to as TCP/IP architecture

e.g. web browsing
- http GET request (app)
- connection with remote process (transport)
- communication source and destination (network)
- sends data to device in subnet (link)

encapsulating layers
- each protocol has header and payload
- higher layers encapsulated in lower layers
  - transmitting: push header, hand to lower layer
  - receiving: pop header, hand to higher layer

end-hosts vs routers

socket comm
- OS provides socket API for developers
  - eases app development
- IP address: uniquely identifies network interface on a host
  - IPv4 - 32 bit addr (128.220.13.64)
  - IPv6 - 128 bit addr (2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888)
- port number: uniquely identifies socket on a host
  - 16 bits
  - sockets for TCP and UDP can use same number
  - processes communicate via sockets
