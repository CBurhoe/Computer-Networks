for send and recv and printf, don't use null terminator (Homework 0)

hubs, switches, and routers

hubs and repeaters
- connect machines on same Layer 2 LAN
- broadcast devices: all frames are transmitted out all physical ports

switches and bridges
- connect machines on same layer 2 LAN
- unicast devices: only send frames out seelcted physical port based on destination MAC

routers
- connect between LANs at Layer 3 (e.g. WAN)
- unicast devices: only send packet out selected physical port based on destination IP address


repeaters and hubs: physical layer

switches and bridges: link layer

routers: network layer


hubs and repeaters

physical layer: hubs
- joins multiple input lines electrically
	- designed to hold multiple line cards
	- does not necessarily amplify signal
- similar to repeaters
	- operates at physical layer

physical layer: repeaters
- distance limitation in LANs
	- electrical signal becomes weaker (attenuates) as it travels/propagates
	- limits length of a LAN
- repeaters join LANs together into a single LAN
	- analog electrical device
	- continuously monitors electrical signals
	- transmits amplified copy
	- does not understand meaning of bits


limitations of hubs and repeaters
- one large shared link
	- every bit sent everywhere - limits aggregate throughout
- cannot support multiple LAN technologies
	- does not buffer or interpret frames
	- can't interconnect different rates or formats
- limitation on maximum number of nodes and distances
	- shared medium imposes length limits (e.g. ethernet's collision detection)
	- signals are not rebuilt - signal fades and/or noise increases



bridges and switches

link layer: bridges
- connects two or more LANs at the link layer
	- extracts dest addr from the frame
	- looks up dest in a table
	- forward the frame to the appropriate segment
- each segment can carry its own traffic

link layer: switches
- typically connect individual computers
	- rather than shared ethernet
- similar to bridge
	- but typically connects hosts
- supports concurrent communication
	- host A talks to C, while B talks to D

bridges/switches: traffic isolation
- filter packets
	- frame only forwarded to the necessary segments
	- segments can support separate transmissions


routers
- each router has a forwarding table
	- maps dest addr to outgoing interface
- basic operation
	- receives packets
	- look at ehader to determine dest addr
	- lookup output interface in forwarding table
	- modify packet header (e.g., decrement TTL, update checksum)
	- forward packet on outgoing interface
- major components
	- line card (data plane)
	- switching fabric
	- processor (control plane)

benefits of CIDR and longest prefix
- efficiency
	- prefixes can be allocated at finer granularity
- hierarchical aggregation
	- upstream ISP can aggregate continuous prefixes from downstream ISP to shorter prefix
