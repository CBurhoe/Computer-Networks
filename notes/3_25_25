midterm 2: lecture 8 to now
- focus on shortest path stuff
- different policies and their effect on outcome



anycast and multicast


unicast: one to one

broadcast: one to all

anycast: one to one, but from a number of possible recipients

multicast: one to many, but from a subset of possible recipients


overview
- IP anycast
  - N destinations, 1 should receive message
  - providing a service from multiple network locations
  - using routing protocols for automated failover
- multicast protocols
  - N destinations, N should receive the message
  - e.g.
    - IP multicast
    - SRM
    - PGM


anycast

limitations of DNS-based failover
- failover/load balancing via multiple A records
- if server fails, service unavailable for DNS TTL
  - very low TTL: extra load on DNS
  - browsers cache DNS mappings

motivation for IP Anycast
- failure problem: client has resolved IP address
  - what if IP address can represent many servers?
- load balancing/failover via IP address, rather than DNS
- IP anycast is simple reuse of existing protocols
  - multiple instances of a service share same IP address
  - each instance announces IP address/prefix in BGP/IGP
  - routing infrastructure directs packets to nearest instance of the service
    - can use same selection criteria as installing routes in the FIB
  - no special capabilities in servers, clients, or networks
    - the only difference is that multiple instances of the server all use the same IP address
    - so the one with the shortest path has requesting traffic directed to it
    - if one path fails, send traffic to next shortest path one

anycast limitations
- many tier-1 ISPs filter ingress prefixes longer than /24
  - publish a /24 to get a "single" anycasted address - poor utilization
- scales poorly with the number of anycast groups
  - each group needs entry in the global routing table
- not trivial to deploy
  - obtain IP prefix and AS number, speak BGP, multiple servers/sites
- subject to limitations of IP routing
  - no notion of load or other applicaiton layer metrics
  - convergence depends on routing protocol
  - not always optimal routing for latency and bandwidth
- failover disrupts active TCP flows (TCP is stateful)
  - may react to network changes, even if server online


anycast in practice
- root nameservers (DNS) anycasted
  - letter.root-servers.net
- CDNs anycast "edge" DNS nameservers
  - even DNS over HTTPS
- clouds anycast virtual machine IP addresses
  - get traffic into the cloud WAN quickly; e.g. AWS global accelerator
- distributed denial of service mitigation
  - anycast server IP addresses from scrubbing centers
  - move scrubbing close to source


multicast
- many receivers
  - receiving same content
- applications
  - video conferences, streaming
  - online gaming
  - IP television (IPTV)
  - financial data feeds

iterated unicast
- unicast message to each recipient
- advantages
  - simple to implement
  - no modifications to network
- disadvantages
  - high overhead on sender
  - redundant packets on links
  - sender must maintain list of receivers

  IP multicast
  - embed receiver driven tree in network layer
    - sender sends a single packet to the group
    - receivers "join" and "leave" the tree
  - advantages
    - low overhead on the sender
    - avoids redundant network traffic
  - disadvantages
    - control-plane protocols for multicast groups
    - overhead of duplicating packets on the routers

note: predefined multicast IP addresses
  - e.g. 224.x.x.x
  - this tells the router that if a dst IP address for a packet uses a multicast address, it should be duplicating/forwarding to ALL addresses, not just shortest path


single vs multiple senders
- source based tree
  - separate tree for each sender
  - tree optimized for that sender
  - requires multiple trees for multiple senders
- shared tree
  - one common tree
  - spanning tree that reaches all participants
  - single tree may be inefficient
  - avoids having many different trees

multicast addresses
- multicast group defined by IP address
  - multicast addresses look like unicast addresses
  - reserved multicast range - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
- using multicast IP addresses
  - sender send to the iP address
  - (see slide 24)


IGMP v1 (IP Gorup Management Protocol)
- two types of IGMP messages (both have IP TTL of 1)
  - host membership query
    - routers query local networks to discover which groups have members
  - host membership report
    - hosts report each group (e.g. multicast address) they belong to
    - send over network interface that brought the query
- routers maintain group membership
  - host sends IGMP report to join a group
  - multicast routers periodically issue host membership query to determine liveness of group members
  - note: no explicit "leave" message from clients
    - just have to let it expire and don't send report in response to query

IGMP Improvements
- IGMP v2 added
  - if multiple routers, one with lowest IP elected querier
  - explicit leave messages for faster pruning
- v3
  - (see slide 27)

IP multicast is best effort
- sender sends packet to IP multicast address
  - loss may affect multiple receivers


challenges for reliable multicast
- send an ACK like TCP
  - ACK-implosion if all destinations ACK at once
  - source does not know number of destinations
- how to retransmit
  - to all? one bad link effects entire group
  - only where losses? loss near sender makes retransmission as inefficient as replicated unicast
- negative acknowledgements (NAK) more common

Scalable reliable multicast (SRM)
- data packets sent via IP multicast
  - data includes sequence numbers
- upon packet failure
  - if failures are relatively rare, use NAKs instead
    - did not receive an unexpected packet
  - sender issues heartbeats if no real traffic
    - the receiver known when to expect the packet (and can NAK)

handling failure in SRM
- receiver multicasts a NAK
  - or send NAK to sender, who multicasts confirmation
- scale through NAK suppression
  - if received a NAK, don't NAK yourself
  - add random delays before NAKing (similar to random backoff in MAC)
- repair through packet retransmission
  - from initial sender
  - from designated local repairer


pragmatic general multicast (PGM) (RFC 3208)
- similar approach as SRM: IP multicast + NAKs
  - but more techniques for scalability
- hierarchy of PGM-aware network elements
  - NAK suppression- similar to SRM
  - NAK elimination- send at most one NAK upstream
    - or completely handle with local repair
  - constrained forwarding- repair data can be suppressed downstream if no NAK seen on that port
  - forward error correction: reduce need to NAK
- works when only sender is multicast capable
  - receiver does not need to multicast NAK

conclusion
- anycast
  - multiple servers share same IP address
  - networks routers handle data forwarding
  - advertise IP address into routing protocols (e.g. BGP)
  - clients connect to "closest" server
- multicast
  - send to one IP address but multiple listeners
  - network constructs multicast tree to listeners (similar to spanning tree)
  - network does the work
