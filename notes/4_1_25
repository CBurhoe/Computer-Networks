midterm 2 review

1. which fields do nats modify
- source and dest IP addr
- source and dest port numbers
- headers checksum
NOT: identification field or sequence number


b. NATs
- nat creates and maintains a mapping between the original <source IP, source port> and the translated <IP address, port> when the packet
  is from host 1 to host 3


c. The NAT does not modify the IP or TCP fields when host 1 sends a packet to host 2
- True
- if answered false, can send a regrade request


2. IP Tunneling

a. IP tunnel creates a virtual point-to-point link
- True 

b. tunnel entry router encapsulates the IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 packet addressed to the tunnel exit router

3. 
a. shortest path tree from a to all other nodes (this one was correct from my memory)

b. benefits of link-state over distance vector
- Converges faster
- achieves global optimum and no loop in the result
NOT: less traffic overhead

c. list two possible solutions for finding the destination host address when building a forwarding table
- learn and flood; ethernet LAN and home network
- inject into routing protocol; enterprise network
- disseminate using a different protocol; iBGP backbone network
- directory service; some data centers

4. routing convergence

a. what problems happen before covergence in link state routing
- lost packets due to blackholes and TTL expiry
- looping packets consuming resources
- out-of-order packets reaching the destination

b. what is the limitation of using a finite infinity e.g. 16
- struggles when routers are separated by more than 16 hops
NOT: only works for count to infiinity cyucles of 2; makes it more difficult to announce routes externally; there is no limitation, solves the entire problem

c. is there a unique and stable solution 
- yes
- 130, 30, 40, 20

d. what happens if 40 is removed
- becomes a bad gadget
- no stable solution
- path choice will loop

5. BGP
a. which path would host c use to reach host b
- c > AS4 > AS3 > b

b. which path would host a use to reach host c
- a > AS2 > AS0 > AS1 > AS4 > c

c. how does BGP prevent loops
- path vector routing
- BGP includes ASes who propagated the announcement
- ASes can look for an AS repeated in the path

d. which path would you expect packets to traverse from host a to host b and why?
- a > AS2 > AS5 > b
- Gao-Rexford policies: prefer routes through customers over routes through peers and providers

6. measurement
a. give one reason measurement is crucial to network ops
- network operations
  - billing customers
  - detecting, diagnosing, and fixing problems
  - planning outlay of new equipment

b. what method can be adopted to reduce per packet and per flow overhead
- packet sampling


7. anycast and multicast
a. what is the benefit of multicast compared to iterative unicast
- consumes less bandwidth in the network, sender does not work as hard

b. the main difference between multi and any cast is that multicast sends to multiple hosts that opt into the group, while anycast sends to all hosts
- false

c. the reliable multicast protocols PGM and SRM use ACKs to achieve reliable data transmission over best effort network
- false
- they adopt NAK instead of ACK
